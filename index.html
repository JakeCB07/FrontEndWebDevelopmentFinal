            Washington is full of recreational activities that any outdoors enthusiast would love! For the adrenaline
            seekers, we have skiing at Snoqualmie National Forest or
            kayaking at Lake Washington. For those looking for quiet getaway, try fishing at the Walla Walla river or
            camping at Mount Rainier national park? Not the outdoors-ey type?
            Then take a trip to Seattle! There's no shortage of tourist traps. Visit the 605 ft tall wonder that is the
            Seattle Space Needle. Or if you aren't a fan of heights,
            head over to the Woodland Park Zoo for some family-friendly fun. When you're planning your next vacation, be
            sure to keep Washington in mind!

            <h3>History</h3>
            Washington didn't become a state until 1889. However, this doesn't mean nothing notable happened before then
            in terms of U.S. history. In 1805, Lewis and Clark walked along
            the Snake and Columbia rivers on their expedition across North America. In 1926, Bertha Knight Landes became
            the first female mayor of a major U.S. city. Bertha undertook the
            task of attempting to clean up Seattle, which was rife with illegal gambling and drinking at the time. In
            more recent history, 1980 marks the devastating eruption of
            Mount St. Helens, where 57 lives were lost and over $1 billion dollars in damages occurred.
