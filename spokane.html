        <h2>The Lilac City</h2>
        From the beautiful Spokane Falls, to the Centennial Trail, Spokane is a city with plenty of natural sights to
        see! The man-made structures are nothing to scoff at either.
        Manito park is home to many gorgeous species of flowers and even has a greenhouse containing tropical plants.
        The Monroe Street bridge leads directly to the Spokane downtown area,
        which is home to the River Park Square mall. A large 5-story mall that overlooks the Spokane river. With a wide
        variety of goods and services, Spokane's downtown area has a little
        something for everybody!
