            <p>
                Yakima is a bustling urban city built by agriculture. The rich soil of the Yakima Valley made it an
                ideal
                location for growing all manner of crops. The Union Gap area of
                Yakima has become the city's central shopping area, which is home to the Yakima Mall. Many events such
                as
                the Central Washington State Fair are held at the Yakima
                Valley Sun Dome, a 85,500 square foot stone dome near the downtown area of Yakima. Yakima has many
                outdoor
                activities too, such as camping in the forests to the west and
                fishing along the Yakima river.
